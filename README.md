# Python & DSA — Structured Learning and Interview Preparation

This repository offers a **well-structured, end-to-end learning path** to master **Python**, build strong proficiency in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, reinforce **core Computer Science fundamentals**, and prepare confidently for **technical interviews**.

It is designed not just for coding practice, but for developing **problem-solving clarity, algorithmic thinking, and interview-ready communication skills**.

---

## 🧱 Learning Pillars

The repository is built around four complementary pillars:

1. **Hands-on Python and DSA Coding**
2. **Real-world Mini Projects**
3. **Theory and Conceptual Understanding**
4. **Interview-Readiness Practice**

Together, these ensure balanced growth across implementation, reasoning, and communication.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By working through this repository, you will:

* Build a **solid foundation in Python programming**
* Gain mastery over **core data structures**
* Understand and implement **essential algorithms**
* Develop structured **problem-solving approaches**
* Write **clean, readable, and well-documented code**
* Use this repository as a **central reference and practice hub** for interviews and coding contests

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.9+** (recommended)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amuktha-goteti/Python-and-DSA-with-Python.git
cd Python-and-DSA-with-Python
```

---

## 🧩 Problem-Solving Workflow

Each problem inside the `problems/` directory follows a **deliberate, interview-oriented structure**:

1. **Problem statement**
2. **Initial (naive) thought process**
3. **Naive solution** — intuitive but inefficient
4. **Optimized approach** — refined logic
5. **Optimized solution** — clean, commented implementation
6. **Time and Space Complexity analysis**

This progression mirrors how interviewers expect you to think and communicate.

### Example Template

```python
"""
------------------------------------------------------------
📝 Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers `nums`, return the maximum sum of any
contiguous subarray.

Example:
Input:  [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
------------------------------------------------------------

🧠 Naive Approach:
- Generate all subarrays
- Compute their sums
- Track the maximum
------------------------------------------------------------
"""

def max_subarray_naive(nums):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        current_sum = 0
        for j in range(i, len(nums)):
            current_sum += nums[j]
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

"""
------------------------------------------------------------
⚡ Optimized Approach (Kadane’s Algorithm)
------------------------------------------------------------
"""

def max_subarray_optimized(nums):
    current_sum = max_sum = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

If test cases are added using `pytest` or `unittest`:

```bash
pytest
# or
python -m unittest
```

---

## 📘 Theory and Conceptual Understanding

Located in `Theory-and-Conceptual-Understanding/`, this section strengthens **fundamentals interviewers often probe indirectly**.

### Suggested Workflow

* Read once for understanding
* Revisit weekly alongside DSA practice
* Revise thoroughly before interviews

### Outcome

You gain the ability to **explain concepts clearly**, not just implement them.

---
