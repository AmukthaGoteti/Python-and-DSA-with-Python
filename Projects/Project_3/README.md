A Python-driven framework designed for **automatic detection, simulation, and visualization of logic hazards** in combinational digital circuits.
The analyzer incorporates realistic gate-delay modeling, identifies glitches during input transitions, and recommends Boolean corrections using consensus terms.

## 📌 Problem Statement

A Boolean expression may be logically sound, yet **unequal propagation delays** in real hardware can still introduce transient output glitches—commonly referred to as **logic hazards**.

Traditional manual analysis:

* Does not scale well
* Overlooks timing-induced failures
* Becomes error-prone as complexity increases

This project delivers a **fully automated, timing-aware approach** to hazard analysis.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

* Custom Boolean expression input
* Complete truth table generation
* Randomized gate-delay assignment
* Gate-level transition simulation
* Automated identification of:

  * Static hazards
  * Dynamic hazards
  * Essential hazards
* Hazard severity evaluation via toggle counts
* Automatic consensus-term recommendations
* Optional waveform-based visualization
* Clean, modular, and extensible design

## 🧠 Hazard Classification

| Hazard Type   | Description                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Static**    | Output momentarily changes despite a stable expected value |
| **Dynamic**   | Output oscillates multiple times before settling           |
| **Essential** | Hazard caused by unavoidable delay dependencies            |

## 🧪 Sample Input

```text
Enter Boolean expression (& | ~): (~A & ~B) | (A & ~C)
Variables (comma-separated): A, B, C
Show truth table? (y/n): y
Show waveform? (y/n): y
```

---

## 📊 Example Output

```text
Hazard 1: Static-1 Hazard
Transition: (0, 0, 0) → (0, 0, 1)
Confidence: 35%
Severity (toggles): 2
Explanation: OR reconvergent path delay mismatch
Suggested Consensus Term: ~A & ~B
```

## 📈 Waveform Analysis

> Output glitches are visualized using step-based waveforms to enable precise timing inspection.

**Example:**
Waveform plots clearly expose transient behavior during critical input transitions.

---

## 🧩 Hazard Elimination Strategy

To remove static hazards without altering logic functionality, the analyzer proposes **consensus terms**.

**Illustration**

```text
Original: A·B + A'·C
Improved: A·B + A'·C + B·C
```
